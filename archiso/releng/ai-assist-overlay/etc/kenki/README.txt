KENKI OS - /etc/kenki/
=====================

This directory contains the KENKI AI assistant, configuration, and post-install scripts for the live ISO.

- ai-assist/      # All AI assistant Python modules
- install.sh      # Post-install setup script
- config.json     # Default configuration

These files are copied into the live system during ISO build and are available after boot.
